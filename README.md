#  Car Recommendation System  

The **Car Recommendation System** is a data-driven web application that helps users find the best cars based on their preferences such as **price, fuel type, transmission, year, and kilometers driven**.  

Built using **Flask (Python)**, it filters and ranks cars from a real-world dataset to suggest the most relevant options for the user — simplifying the car selection process through intelligent data insights.

##  Features  
-  **Smart Filtering** – Search by price range, fuel type, transmission, model year, and km driven  
-  **Top Recommendations** – Ranks results by latest model and least km driven  
-  **Interactive Web Interface** – Simple and responsive UI built with HTML & CSS  
-  **Data Handling** – Efficient processing using Pandas  
-  **Machine Learning Ready** – Easily extendable for predictive price or car value estimation

##  Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Dataset:** Car details dataset (from Kaggle or custom CSV file)  


##  How It Works  
1. User enters preferred filters (price, fuel, etc.)  
2. Flask backend filters the dataset based on criteria  
3. The system sorts and displays **Top Recommended Cars**  
4. Results are shown dynamically in a responsive web page
